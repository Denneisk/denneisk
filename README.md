Big fan and self-proclaimed pioneer of [Expression 2](https://github.com/wiremod/wire/wiki/Expression-2). This portfolio looks bad, but in the future it'll be a lot cooler:
- [Five Nights at Garry's](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2891811297) - Faithful FNAF clone that's contained entirely within a Gmod save and requires only Wiremod and one other addon.
- Secret project #1
- Secret project #2

*If you are a Gmod save/dupe creator who likes making games using E2, please contact me!*

<details><summary>Other langs+history</summary>
  
- Apparently I once wrote a bunch of Typescript (but mostly styled like Javascript) on some Microsoft drag and drop game coding thing. It sucked a lot but I put too much effort in it.
- I did Java in college and much prefer C#.
- I did C and C-styled C++ for an amateurish stint in high school–early college—not very good at it, but I'd love to spend more time in it.
- I am fond of CIL and to a lesser extent x86 assembly.
- I started with Lua on Roblox, actually. I hated it back then. I couldn't understand it. Mentally incapable; logic was simply impossible for me to comprehend. Now? Well, I like Lua, now, let's just leave it at that.
- There was some game jam where I did a smidge of GDScript for a friend.
- I also touched some C# in making an AR game for college. It sucked hard and never went anywhere, mostly my fault.
- Micro-optimizations are beautiful.
